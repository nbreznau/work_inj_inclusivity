cow_code,Correlates of War standard numeric country codes
independence,"This variable gives information on the year a nation state becomes independent whether this arises out of association or end of colonial rule. If there were periods where the country lost independence but returned to its present or similar form (world wars or temporary annexation), then this code reflects the first instance except for cases of prolonged colonization, and having no work-injury laws prior to that colonization."
labor_workinjury_firstlaw,"The year of introduction of the first law of any kind. It is the year the law is passed, not the moment it comes into force, so long as a timing of the law coming into force is written in the law or decided upon prior to its passing."
labor_workinjury_firstlaw_sspw,Taken from the SSPW 2017 country-specific html files using a text mining routine (Social Security Programs Throughout the World Data from the U.S. Social Security Administration). In our investigation of each country we often find different years than what is in the SSPW data. We include the SSPW data as of 2017 here for user reference as a variable. We do not argue that the SSPW is incorrect. They simply do not have a consistent coding scheme.
labor_workinjury_firstins,"This is the year of the first law providing insurance against work-related injury. Insurance refers to the common definition, not the legal definition, as providing some form of shared protection against risk. That is why we refer to this as risk-pooling, not insurance, in the variable name. This variable indicates the first instance of mandatory social risk pooling. A provident fund, for example, counts as risk-pooling because workers have a shared pool of resources to protect them in case of an accident; again this is only by law and says nothing about the effectiveness or implementation of the law. Simply having a law requiring employer liability is not risk-pooling in our definition, because there is no insurance (fund, insurance policy, etc.) backing up the legal liability. If the first law of any form in a country was a risk-pooling law, then this variable is identical to labor_workinjury_firstlaw. If only a single occupation is covered but the state makes insurance mandatory for the entire single occupation (e.g., railroad workers or miners), then this would also count as the first risk-pooling law."
labor_workinjury_first_fund,First instance of risk pooling as a provident fund. It is missing if the country went directly from no law or employer liability without a fund to social insurance. Coding rules otherwise follow labor_workinjury_firstins. Provident fund means that paying money into a centralized fund is mandatory. This fund has the purpose of paying compensation.
labor_workinjury_firstnat_carriedover,"This variable indicates, whether a law from colonial, foreign or imperial rule is carried over after independence. The exceptions are states that became nation states and carried the law over and did not have a geopolitical change (i.e., boundaries stayed the same); for these cases the first national law could come while not a fully autonomous nation state"
labor_workinjury_firstlaw_programtype,"The program type of a work-injury law can either be **Risk-Pooling**, meaning that there is some kind of mandatory risk pooling or **Employer liability** meaning that there is no involvement of the state in financing and risk pooling, only an obligation for the employers to compensate in the case of work accidents. In this version of the variable, **Risk-Pooling** refers to either provident funds set up by the state or made mandatory by the state or actual social insurance with a private or state carrier (as with the coding of labor_workinjury_firstins). **Employer liability** is not the same as common or civil law codes that assign fault in case of injury. **Employer liability** means that there is a specific law targeting employers in industrial accidents and deaths as something more than basic common and civil codes. This is a variable constructed from a combination of labor_workinjury_firstlaw, labor_workinjury_first_fund, and labor_workinjury_first_socins"
labor_workinjury_firstlaw_bluecollar_fullcoverage,"This is the year of full coverage for all blue-collar groups: manual labor; excluding agriculture and domestic workers. All means at least two-thirds, or all the major sectors of industry; exceptions should not be occupation or industry-specific. We code this as covering all as long as all enterprises with at least 5 or more employees are covered."
replacement_rate_perm_sspw,"The average replacement rate after a work-injury, for a permanent or apparently permanent disability for the first 12 months of incapacity, rate for 2020 or latest available, source = GWIP 2020"
duration_perm_sspw,The duration in months
replacement_rate_temp_sspw,"The average replacement rate after a work-injury, from previous income for the first 6 months of incapacity to work in 2020 or latest available, source = GWIP 2020"

workinjury_coverage_ILO,"Coverage rates as the mean of the ILO's Global Employment Injury Protection study of 2014, and World Social Protection Report of 2021"
workinjury_coverage_SIED_harmo,"The SIED variable acovratl, coverage of workers under work-injury law as a percentage of the labor force with missing values imputed from ILO GEIP coverage data, source = SIED 2020 & GEIP 2020"

workinjury_replacement_rate_single_SIED_harmo,"The SIED variable azrr26si, replacement rate after a work-injury for the first 6 months for a standard net single worker, imputed from replacement_rate_temp, rate for 2020 or latest, source = SIED 2020 & GWIP 2020"
workinjury_replacement_rate_single_SIED_harmo_full,"The SIED variable azrr26si, replacement rate after a work-injury for the first 6 months for a standard net single worker, imputed from replacement_rate_temp and socioeconomic/historical variables, rate for 2020 or latest, source = SIED 2020 & GWIP 2020"
