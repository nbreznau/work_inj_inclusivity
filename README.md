### Abstract

I present new measures of generosity, coverage and institutional characteristics of work-injury policy across 189 countries in the Global Work-Injury Policy Dataset (GWIP) version 2.0. To date, major research efforts produced detailed social policy data for the rich Western countries, and more recently countries of Eastern, Central and Central-Eastern Europe. One of the products of this work, the Social Insurance Entitlements Dataset (SIED) has become a benchmark for social policy research. Using hand-coded data, indicators from the International Labor Organization, and the U.S. Social Security Administration’s ‘Social Security Programs Throughout the World’, and computational social science, I demonstrate a process to successfully extend and harmonize the SIED work-injury coverage and generosity variables to cover the Global South; in total 167 countries, plus a further 189 with imputation for the year 2020 or latest. These data will help further various welfare state and social policy research agendas, in particular in the area of work-injury policy which is often understudied in comparison to other social security policies. I analyze to classic hypotheses in welfare state research to demonstrate and guide the potential contribution of these data. One is a logic of industrialization and the other a cultural values hypothesis about work-injury policy development.

### User Notes

The computing environment used for this repository is documented in the knitted versions of the code at the end under "Colophon". Users can view the code in action in these documents using a web browser. [01_Extraction.Rmd](https://github.com/nbreznau/work_inj_inclusivity/blob/main/01_Extraction.Rmd) imports and prepares the GWIPv1 SIED and other relevant data. [02_Measurement.Rmd](https://github.com/nbreznau/work_inj_inclusivity/blob/main/02_Measurement.Rmd) provides a host of checks and tests about harmonizing our data with the SIED. [03_Analyses.Rmd](https://github.com/nbreznau/work_inj_inclusivity/blob/main/03_Analyses.Rmd) provides first looks at how the data can be used.
